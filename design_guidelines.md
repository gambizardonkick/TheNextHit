# TheNextHit - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Hybrid Approach**: Material Design foundation with casino-themed customization. This balances the utility-focused nature of a prediction tool with the visual appeal expected in gaming applications. Reference inspiration from Stake.com's clean data presentation and modern crypto casino aesthetics.

## Core Design Principles
1. **Data Clarity First**: Information hierarchy prioritizes readability and scannability
2. **Casino Sophistication**: Premium feel without overwhelming the functional purpose
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Reveal complexity as users need it
4. **Trust & Transparency**: Design reinforces the "provably fair" concept

## Typography System

**Font Families**:
- Primary: Inter (Google Fonts) - clean, modern, excellent for data

- H2 (Section Headers): Space Grotesk, 2xl, font-semibold
- H3 (Card Titles): Inter, xl, font-semibold
- Body Text: Inter, base, font-normal
- Data/Results: Inter, sm/base, font-medium (tabular numbers)
- Labels: Inter, sm, font-medium, uppercase tracking-wide
- Buttons: Space Grotesk, base, font-semibold

## Layout System

**Spacing Primitives**: Use Tailwind units of **2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16** for consistent rhythm
- Micro spacing: p-2, gap-2 (8px)
- Standard spacing: p-4, gap-4, m-6 (16-24px)
- Section spacing: p-8, py-12, py-16 (32-64px)
- Large breaks: py-20, py-24 (80-96px)

**Container Strategy**:
- Max width: max-w-7xl for main content
- Form containers: max-w-2xl centered
- Result cards: max-w-4xl
- Full-bleed backgrounds with contained content

**Grid System**:
- Casino selector: 2-column grid (md:grid-cols-2)
- Input forms: Single column with logical grouping
- Results display: Responsive card grid (grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3)

- Cards: Elevated shadow (shadow-xl with colored glow)

**Gradients**:
- Primary gradient: Purple (#7C3AED) to blue (#3B82F6)

**Desktop (lg:)**:
- Three-column results grid where appropriate
- Side-by-side form sections
- Optimized for scanning large result sets
- More generous spacing throughout

---

## Interaction Patterns

**Form Submission**:
1. Button shows loading spinner
2. Form dims slightly
3. Progress indicator appears
4. Results fade in with stagger animation

**Casino/Game Mode Switching**:
- Smooth transition with fade/slide
- Previous results clear
- Form resets with new placeholder values

**Number Input** (Keno picked numbers):
- Comma or space-separated input
- Real-time validation showing selected count
- Visual preview of selected numbers as badges below input

**Error States**:
- Inline validation messages below inputs
- Red accent color for errors
- Clear, actionable error text

## Animation Guidelines
Use sparingly and purposefully:
- Page transitions: Fade with slight scale (200ms)
- Card hover: Subtle lift with scale(1.02) (150ms)
- Button interactions: Press scale(0.98) (100ms)
- Progress bar: Smooth width transition
- Results appearance: Stagger fade-in (50ms delay between cards)
- NO: Excessive parallax, floating animations, or distracting background motion
